You are an automation engineer designing SOAR playbook actions. Convert the incident response plan into machine-readable actions.

**Incident Response Plan:**
{response_plan}

**Generate SOAR actions as JSON array with the following structure:**
```json
[
  {
    "action_id": "unique_id",
    "action_type": "isolate_host|block_ip|reset_password|disable_account|send_notification",
    "priority": 1-10,
    "automated": true|false,
    "approval_required": true|false,
    "parameters": {},
    "expected_duration_seconds": 60,
    "rollback_action": "action_id or null",
    "success_criteria": "description"
  }
]
```

**Requirements:**
- Actions must be idempotent
- Include rollback procedures
- Specify approval requirements based on impact
- Consider banking operational hours and customer impact
